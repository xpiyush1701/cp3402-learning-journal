### Estimated Hours
It took me an approximate 2.75 hours to learn the content this week.
- GitHub repository setup (0.75 hours)
- Trello board setup and group agreement input (1 hour)
- Slack channel setup & integration of Trello + GitHub (0.5 hours)
- LinkedIn connection and Discord channel setup (0.5 hours)

### Content Insights
I learnt that syncing GitHub and Trello into Slack simplifies handling numerous environments by being able to track everything in one including commits, tasks, and messages.

Adding cards in Trello gave me a visual representation of expectations and future tasks systemically.

Integrating an agreement value prevented everyone in the group, including myself from saying “I’ll do my best,” to “What exactly can I contribute?” This small task shifted my mindset that aims to add value to the team workflow.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Employers expect junior devs to understand Git workflows and how they are an beneficial step in group projects. These include knowing how to clone, commit, push, and branch.

Connecting with team members early is important not only for the final report but also for building a professional tech network from university.

Using Trello for planning mirrors agile teamwork, similar to GitHub Projects in real-world companies. This means I’ll feel more comfortable in sprint-based workflows within group projects in the real-world.

Slack is used for startups to global tech firms like Shopify, Pinterest and Airbnb. Learning to work in a Slack-driven environment prepares me for dynamic teamwork across multiple softwares.

Being connected with my team and writing project summaries will help build a professional digital footprint. Within technology industries, recruiters often check your LinkedIn and GitHub to view projects. These help companies determine adaptability and willingness to improve through constant learning.
