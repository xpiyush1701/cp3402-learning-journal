## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 8

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I ran a learning experiment to compare the effectiveness of active recall and passive review when studying PHP. The aim was to test if active recall (retrieving information from memory) helps me remember and apply coding knowledge more effectively in comparison to simply re-reading or watching tutorials without practice. 

### Estimated Hours
2.5 hours
- 1 hour setting up experiment and quiz using ChatGPT
- Apprximately 25 minutes per session for quiz
- 30 minutes testing and analysing results

### Content Insights
#### Hypothesis:
I believe that active recall will improve my retention and understanding of PHP concepts more than passive review because a theory suggests that actively retrieving information strengthens memory and improves learning.

#### Method
I created two focused study sessions, each lasting 25 minutes, on different PHP topics.

Session A – Passive Review
- I re-read my PHP notes and re-watched parts of a video tutorial on PHP functions and include statements before starting to write code.

Session B – Active Recall
- Without referring to any material, I attempted to write sample PHP code demonstrating functions, includes, and loops. After each attempt, I reviewed the code after to identify mistakes and correct them.

#### Quiz Results
PHP Functions (Passive Review)
- Score: 6/10
- Comment: Lots of syntax errors
- Time taken to learn concepts: 20 minutes (minimum)

PHP Includes & Loops (Active Recall)
- Score: 8/10
- Comment: Mostly correct - small mistakes like missing bracket and colon
- Time taken to learn concepts: 15 minutes (minimum)

#### Conclusion
Active recall noticeably outperformed passive review in both speed and accuracy of test results. I remembered more, wrote better code, and felt more confident during the quiz. This suggests that testing yourself is more effective than simply reviewing material.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Using this technique could help me prepare for technical interviews or practical coding tasks. This approach will likely make me a more efficient learner and better prepared for coding assessments in future roles.
