## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 4

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on setting up a local development environment for my WordPress site using LocalWP. I created a new site from scratch rather than importing an existing one, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience with installing WordPress locally and managing a site on my own machine, locally.
- LocalWP: https://localwp.com/

### Estimated Hours

I spent around 2 hours this week:
- 2 hours setting up and exploring LocalWP

### Content Insights
Setting up a local site using LocalWP was much easier than expected. The process was highly automated, especially when it came to setting up the database, which usually requires manual configuration in tools like XAMPP. I found the local environment responsive and convenient.

While I didnâ€™t deploy the site, I did start reviewing how migration works using plugins like All-in-One WP Migration and WP Migrate. I now understand the concept of working locally and then pushing updates to a live environment.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning to work in a local development environment is a foundational skill in the web development industry. It improves efficiency, allows for safe experimentation, and ensures better control over the development process.

Now that I know how to launch and manage a WordPress site locally, I feel more confident about testing features before deploying them live. This process mirrors the real-world development workflow and will be a valuable skill in future roles, especially those involved in CMS-based development.

Moving forward, I plan to:
- Learn how to migrate local WordPress sites to live servers
- Continue experimenting with advanced plugins and SEO tools
