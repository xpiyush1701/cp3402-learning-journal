# CP3402 Learning Journal

## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 9

### Learning Activities & Resources
I created SCSS partials for variables, mixins, and base styles, and imported them into a main style.scss file. I used the Live Sass Compiler extension in VS Code to compile the SCSS into CSS. I encountered an issue where the CSS didnâ€™t load correctly in the browser, but I resolved it by checking the file paths and ensuring the compiler was running.
