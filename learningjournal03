# CP3402 Learning Journal

## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 3

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I recreated my startup website using WordPress instead of Joomla. I used AWS to host the site and focused on learning how to navigate WordPress’s CMS features, including theme selection, plugin installation, and content editing. I reused much of the content from last week’s Joomla version to save time and concentrate on understanding the WordPress platform.

AWS Hosting Overview: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/host-a-wordpress-site/

### Estimated Hours

I spent around 3.5 hours this week:
- 2 hours setting up WordPress and configuring content
- 1.5 hours on the group interview activity and reflection

### Content Insights
Working with WordPress felt far more intuitive than Joomla. The block editor made it easy to arrange content, and I found plugins especially useful for adding features quickly without needing to code. I encountered a small learning curve when customising themes and understanding the AWS setup, but overall, the experience was smooth and informative.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

WordPress is widely used across industries, and this hands-on experience with setting up and managing a CMS adds to my practical skillset. Understanding how plugins, themes, and cloud hosting interact will be highly beneficial for any future role involving digital content or website administration.

Moving forward, I plan to:
- Explore more advanced WordPress tools such as performance optimisation and SEO plugins
- Improve my knowledge of AWS deployment processes and hosting options
