## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 7

### Learning Activities & Resources
I learnt essential PHP skills, including using `echo` for HTML output, applying conditional statements, loops (`for`, `while`, and `foreach`) as well as creating functions with parameters. I also learned how to include reusable components such as headers and footers using PHPâ€™s `include` feature. I referenced the official PHP documentation and experimented with different structures in my own code.

### Estimated Hours
2 hours
- 1 hour learning practical requirements
- 1 hour experimenting and trying to implement learnings

### Content Insights
PHP enables server-side logic to be embedded within a webpage. Using `echo` inside HTML helped me understand how dynamic content works using two types of languages. Additionally, writing my own function for study recommendations gave me more clarity on how reusable logic works in PHP. I also realised how using `include` for headers and footers simplifies maintenance when working with multiple pages.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Knowing how to build dynamic pages and reuse code is an important learning in web development roles as PHP is still widely used in the industries like WordPress. Understanding the basics of PHP is a useful stepping stone toward more advanced backend technologies and can improve my confidence when working on full-stack projects or internships.
