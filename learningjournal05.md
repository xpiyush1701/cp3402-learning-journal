## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 5

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I learned how to create a child theme in WordPress and applied this to my ongoing project site. I created a new theme folder, added the required styles.css file alongside the metadata that referenced the twentytwentyfour parent theme. i then added a functions.php file to add the styles properly.

After setting up the child theme, I added multiple customisations on the styles.css file, including background colour, heading fonts, button styling, footer design, and link colours. This helped me understand how to separate visual changes from the parent theme so future updates won’t override my work.

As part of this week’s task, I also added this project to my LinkedIn profile, displaying it under the Projects section. I included relevant skills like WordPress, CSS, PHP, Web Development, and Front-End Development to reflect my learning.

### Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 2.5 hours this week:
- 1 hours building the child theme and testing CSS changes
- 1.5 hours documenting and publishing the project to LinkedIn

### Content Insights
Creating a child theme gave me a clearer understanding of how WordPress structures its themes and how to safely customise a site without altering core files. I initially thought child themes were complex, but this week’s practical made the concept approachable and useful.

Adding the child theme to my LinkedIn profile was also a good reminder of the value of public documentation and professional reflection. It pushed me to think about how I explain technical work to a broader audience for employability.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This activity is similar to industry practices in WordPress development. Employers often expect developers to customise or extend themes without compromising future updates, and this practical helped me replicate that.

In the future, I aim to:
- Learn how to override template files using child themes
- Share more of my development work online to build credibility and track progress
