## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 5

### Learning Activities & Resources
I learned how to create a new theme folder for child themes in WordPress. Additionally, I learnt to implemented the styles properly by using a styles.css file alongside the metadata that referenced the twentytwentyfour parent theme. Following this, I then added a functions.php file to use the styles.

After setting up the child theme, I learnt the impact of changing the background colour, font size and button styling on the parent theme. Testing these simple variables allowed me to visually learn how the changes occur.

I learnt how to add a post to my LinkedIn profile, by displaying it under the 'Projects' section. Furthermore, the "LinkedIn Post Guide" pushed me to think about how I can explain technical work.

- LinkedIn Post Guide: https://leanmarketing.com/post/crafting-attention-grabbing-linkedin-post

### Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 1.5 hours this week:
- 1 hour learning how to building the child theme and testing CSS changes
- 0.5 hours learning to document and publish the project to LinkedIn

### Content Insights
Creating a child theme allows WordPress to automatically structure its themes. This process allows for safe customisation to a site without altering core files.

Adding the child theme documentation to my LinkedIn profile taught me how to post projects with detailed overviews and reflections.  

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The implementation of customised child themes deliver employees the ability to personalise and extend themes without compromising future updates or core files. This insight is an excellent way to test themes and reduce the risk of losing files in the workfield, where people may be collaboratively. 

Additonally, writing a analytical report in LinkedIn demonstrates knowledge and understanding of processes behind a project, a great way to show employers incremental learning and solutions based off progression.

In the future, I aim to:
- Learn how to override template files using child themes
- Share more of my development work online to build credibility and track progress
