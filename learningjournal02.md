# CP3402 Learning Journal

## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 2


### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on publishing my website online using AwardSpace and troubleshooting issues that prevented a successful upload. I also explored different web hosting options, including GitHub Pages and other free hosting services, to compare their ease of use. Additionally, I reviewed documentation on domain setup, file transfer, and Joomla site configuration.

### Estimated Hours
I spent around 3 hours trying to upload my website, configuring the hosting settings, and researching alternative hosting solutions.

### Content Insights
Publishing a website turned out to be more challenging than expected due to technical issues with AwardSpace. I initially struggled with file structure and domain linking, making it difficult to generate a public URL. Despite this, I gained valuable insight into how hosting services work and how to troubleshoot deployment issues.

Although I couldnâ€™t fully complete the upload, I understand alternative solutions like using GitHub Pages for static sites, which could be useful for future projects. This experience reinforced the importance of choosing a hosting provider that aligns with project needs.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Through this process, I realised that web hosting and deployment are major skills for any developer. Before I previously focused on just designing and coding websites, but deployment issues can significantly impact the final product. Learning how to debug hosting issues and adapt to different platforms will be useful in future projects and job roles.

Moving forward, I want to:
- Research simpler hosting solutions for static and dynamic websites
- Improve my file management and deployment skills to avoid common issues
- Consider domain and hosting reliability when selecting a provider
